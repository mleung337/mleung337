## Introduction  

My name is Matthew, and I'm currently a second year mathematics student at the University of Toronto's Scarborough Campus.  

So far, I have a good amount of experience using SQL and Python, having used them quite frequently in the introductory computer science courses that I've taken.  

On this page, you'll be able to find every program I've written thus far, whether it be for high school, or for computer science courses I've taken in university. My favourite so far, personally, is the password generator that took me only a week total to write.
